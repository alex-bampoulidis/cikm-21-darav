This project regards the application that is being presented in the demo paper "DaRAV: A Tool for Visualizing De-Anonymization Risks" submitted to CIKM 2021.
A demo may be found at http://139.91.189.216

## How to run the application
- Run: ```docker-compose build``` in order for all the images to be build locally
- Run: ```docker-compose up``` and wait until all the containers run (elastic search might take a little time to run)
- Connect to ```http://localhost``` from your browser

## Notes
- Use ```test@test.com``` as username and ```test``` as password
- All the datasets το be processed should exist in the ```user_datasets``` folder
