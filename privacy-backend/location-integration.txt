1. When uploading data, the option "Location" should be available in the "Data Type" combo box.

2. When a user wants to start a risk analysis on location data, they need to provide the following column types (in parenthesis how they should be written on the risk_analysis_info):
		- userID column ("userid")
		- latitude ("latitude")
		- longtitude ("longtitude")
		- timestamp ("time")		
		- (optionally) locationID ("locationid")
   
   the timestamp format ("timeformat")

   and the following parameters:
		- number of users ("users")
		- radius in km ("radius") - can accept decimals
		- within time ("timewithin")
		- timeframe ("timeframe") - similar to invoices
		
3. The visualisation is a leaflet map and a demo is located at localhost:4201/location.html
   In the demo, the page takes a sample response from an ES search query (like in the runtime environment).
   Careful: The response might be more than 10.000 entries (max allowed by ES), so this needs to be handled.
